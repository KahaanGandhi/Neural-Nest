    "#### Components of a Probablistic Machine Learning Classifier\n",
    "Naive Bayes and logistic regression both require a training set of $m$ input/ouput pairs $\\left( x^{(i)},y^{(i)} \\right)$, where the supserscript notation refers an inidivudal instance in the training set. The ML classification system has four parts: \n",
    "* Feature representation of input. Input $x^{(i)}$ is represented as a vector of features $[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$. $x^{(j)}_i$ represents feature $i$ for input $x^{(j)}$ , synonymous with $x_i$, $f_i$, and $f_i(x)$. \n",

    "* Objective function for learning to minimizes error on training examples. In this case, the cross-entropy loss functions.\n",
    "* An algorithm to optimize the objective function. In this case, stochastic gradient descent (SGD). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sigmoid Function\n",
    "The sigmoid function helps classifiers make a binary decision about the class of a new input. For the input observation $x$, represented by feature vector $[x_1, x_2,...,x_n]$, the classifier output $y$ can be 1 (observation is a member of class) or 0. To calculate $P(y=1|x)$, logistic regression learns (from a training set) a vector of weights and a bias term. Each weight $w_i$ is associated with one of the input features $x_i$, reflecting how important the input feature is to the classification decision, and can be positive or negative. The bias term (intercept) is added to the weighted inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "After learning these values in training, the classifier decides on a test instance by first multiplying each $x_i$ by its weight $w_i$, summing these values, and adding the bias term. $z$, the weighted sum of evidence for this class, can be expressed using dot product notation, using boldface notation to represent vectors: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \\right) + b = \\textbf{w} \\cdot \\textbf{x} + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "To convert $z$ to a legal probability between 0 and 1, we pass it through the sigmoid function $\\sigma(z)$ (resembling an s, and also called the logistic regression). \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "We can then calculate probabilities of the two cases as follows (which sum to 1):\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Setting 0.5 as the decision boundary, for a test instance $x$, we say \"yes\" if $P(y=1|x) > 0.5$, and \" no\" otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "Features are traditionally designed by exaimining the training dataset. When doing this, it's important to consider feature interaction (expressing the prediction as a sum of feature effects when the effect of one feature depends on the value of the other). To avoid extensive human effort of feature design, more recent NLP work has incorporated representation learning: ways to learn features in an automatic and unsupervised manner from the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "When different features have different ranges, it's common to scale them by standariziing input values, resulting in a zero mean and standard deviation of one. That is, if $\\mu_i$ is the mean of the values of feature $\\textbf{x}_i$ across $m$ observations in the input dataset, and $\\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of these values, we replace each feature $\\textbf{x}_i$ with $\\textbf{x}^\\prime_i$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_i = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m x_i^{(j)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sigma_i \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\left(x_i^{(j)} - \\mu_i \\right)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{x}^\\prime_i = \\frac{\\textbf{x}_i - \\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Alternatively, we can normalize the input features, creating a range between 0 and 1: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{x}^\\prime_i  = \\frac{\\textbf{x}_i - \\min(\\textbf{x}_i)}{\\max(\\textbf{x}_i) - min(\\textbf{x}_i)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Both data scaling options help compare values across features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectorization\n",
    "We need to process an entire test set with $m$ test examples needing classification. Each test example $x^{(i)}$ has a feature vector $\\textbf{x}^{(i)}$, for $1 \\leq i \\leq m$. We could calculate $\\hat{y}^{(i)}$ with a for-loop:\n",

We use a loss function that prefers the correct class labels of training examples to more likely.
